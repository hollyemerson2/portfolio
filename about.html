      			<p>
      				I have always loved taking pictures of my favorite moments. My first camera was a little pink point and shoot, and I remember taking pictures of my family and dog. Both taking pictures and looking back on them have always brought me joy. The little moments in life mean the most to me, especially the ones that I share with the people I love most, and photography gives me a way to capture a gimpse of them to remember. I gained more skill in photography when I took a darkroom photography class in high school. I loved how hands on the process was from manually managing camera settings, to developing film, to using the enlarger, to making contact sheets, to developing the final print and hanging it on the close pins to dry. My work became more than just what the subject was, the process that I took to show this particular moment, this particular way made the photograph that much more meaningful. It gave me a foundation in photography that I still use today. I even see how Photoshop was built based on darkroom principles. Meanwhile, everywhere I went, I loved picking up little souvenirs of where I was, whether it was a ticket, branded cup, menu, pin, sticker or business card. I realize now that I was gathering design. The last two years that I have spent at GCU has taught me a lot about design and helped me refine my skills.

      				I still take pictures of my favorite moments. God has shown me beautiful things in this world, from backpacking on “The Ridge,” to seeing my friend spinning in “Summer Bliss,” to spending every college day brightened by “Sunshine,” to taking “Marcus’ Senior Picture,” to discovering “Baptiste Lake” and “Maroon Bells: Fall” with my family & “The Explorer.” I love design and photography, but God is the perfect designer. He created balance & beauty, and I love discovering new parts of his creation each and every day.
